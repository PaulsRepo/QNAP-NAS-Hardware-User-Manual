# Network Expansion Card Installation

 Warning: 
	The following instructions should only be performed by an authorized and 

trained technician. 
	Strictly adhere to the instructions to install a network expansion card on 

the NAS. Failure to do so could result in injury to human body or death.

The TVS-x63 and TS-x79 Proseries provides expansion slots for network expansion. 

Insert an extra network expansion card (optional purchase) to the motherboard of the 

NAS to increase the network bandwidth. 


## 6.1	TVS-463, TVS-663, TVS-863, TS-563, TS-879 Pro, TS-1079 Pro, TS-463U, TS-

463U-RP

Please refer the compatibility table below and replace a proper bracket for the 

network expansion card.

	Network Expansion Card Compatibility
Bracket A (X520-T2)	Intel® Ethernet Server Adapter X520-T2(E10G42B)
Bracket B
(X520-SR2/X520-DA2)	1.	Intel® Ethernet Server Adapter X520-SR2(E10G42BFSR)
2.	Intel® Ethernet Server Adapter X520-DA2(E10G42BTDA)
Bracket C (Emulex)	1.	Emulex OneConnect 10GbE Network Adapters, SFP+ 

Direct attach copper (OCe11102-NX)
2.	Emulex OneConnect 10GbE Network Adapters, Short reach optical (OCe11102-NM)
3.	Emulex OneConnect 10GbE Network Adapters, SFP+ Direct attach copper 

(OCe11102-IX)
4.	Emulex OneConnect 10GbE Network Adapters, Short reach optical (OCe11102-IM)

1.	Turn off the NAS.Disconnect the power adaptor, network cable(s), and any 

other connectors or cables from the NAS. 

2.	Before installing the network expansion card, put on an antistatic wrist 

strap to prevent electrostatic discharge.The crocodile clip should be connected to 

the ground. 
3.	Loosen the screws on the rear of the NAS. 
4.	Remove the case cover of the NAS gently. 
For TVS-463 only: Unscrew and remove the power supply unit.

5.	Loosen the screws and remove the expansion slot cover. 
6.	Grasp the edge of the network expansion card. Align the notch on the gold 

edge of the card with the notch in the PCIe slot. Insert the network expansion card 

to the PCIe slot until it cannot go any further.
7.	Fasten the screws.
8.	Close the case cover and fasten the screws. Connect the power adaptor and 

cables to the NAS. 
9.	To check that the network expansion is recognized by the NAS, power up the 

NAS and login the web interface as an administrator. Go to “System 

Administration”>“Network”>“TCP/IP” and check the total number of network interfaces. 

## 6.2	TS-463U, TS-463U-RP

1.	Turn off the NAS. Disconnect the power adaptor, network cable(s), and any 

other connectors or cables from the NAS.

2.	Before installing the network expansion card, put on an antistatic wrist 

strap to prevent electrostatic discharge. The crocodile clip should be connected to 

the ground.
3.	Loosen the 2 screws on the rear of the NAS as shown in the illustration.
4.	Hold the notch at the edge of the top cover. Remove the top cover in both 

hands.
5.	Loosen the 4 screws as shown in the illustration. 
6.	Grasp the metal edge of the riser card module. Remove the module gently. 
7.	Loosen the screw and remove the expansion slot cover. 
8.	Insert the network expansion card to the PCIe slot until it cannot go any 

further. Then fasten the screw.
9.	Grasp the metal edge of the riser card module. Align the notch on the gold 

edge of the riser card with the notch in the PCIe slot. Insert the riser card module 

to the PCIe slot until it cannot go any further.
10.	Fasten the screws. Close the case cover and fasten the screws. 
11.	Connect the power adaptor and cables to the NAS. 
12.	To check that the network expansion is recognized by the NAS, power up the 

NAS and login the web interface as an administrator. Go to “System Administration” > 

“Network” > “TCP/IP” and check the total number of network interfaces.
 

## 6.3	TS-863U, TS-863U-RP, TS-1263U, TS-1263U-RP

1.	Turn off the NAS. Disconnect the power adaptor, network cable(s), and any 

other connectors or cables from the NAS.
2.	Before installing the network expansion card, put on an antistatic wrist 

strap to prevent electrostatic discharge. The crocodile clip should be connected to 

the ground. 
3.	Loosen the two screws on the rear of the NAS. 
4.	Hold the notch at the edge of the top cover. Remove the top cover in both 

hands. 
5.	Loosen the screw and remove the expansion slot cover. 
 
6.	Grasp the edge of the expansion card. Align the notch on the gold edge of 

the card with the notch in the PCIe slot. Insert the network expansion card to the
