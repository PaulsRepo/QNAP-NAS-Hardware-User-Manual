Note:
	This section applies to rackmount NAS models only.
	The power supply units of TS-879U-RP and TS-EC879U-RP should only be 

replaced by an authorized and trained technician.

10.1	1U Turbo NAS with Hot-swappable PSU

Note: The following instructions should only be performed by an authorized and 

trained technician.

To install a redundant power supply unit to the 1U Turbo NAS, follow the steps 

below.

1.	Turn off the NAS.

2.	Remove the screw and dummy plate. 
 

3.	Insert the power supply unit and push it to the end.
 

4.	Fasten the screw tightly.
 

5.	Turn on the NAS.

Note: To replace a failed power supply unit, turn off the NAS. Then remove the 

failed unit safely and repeat steps 3-5 above to install a new power supply unit. 


10.2	2U/3U Turbo NAS (TS-853U-RP, TS-1253U-RP only)

Note: The following instructions should only be performed by an authorized and 

trained technician.

To replace a failed power supply unit, follow the steps below.

1.	Turn off the NAS.

2.	Hold the black handler and press and hold the green button firmly.
 

3.	Unplug the failed power supply.
 

4.	Plug in a new power supply to the NAS. 
 

5.	Turn on the NAS. 

Enable warning alert for redundant power supply on the web-based interface:

If two power supply units (PSU) have been installed on the NAS and connected to the 

power sockets, both PSU will supply the power to the NAS (applied to 1U and 2U 

models). Users can enable redundant power supply mode in “System Administration” > 

“Hardware” to receive warning alert for the redundant power supply. The NAS will 

beep and record the error messages in “System Logs” when the PSU is plugged out or 

fails.

If only one PSU is installed on the NAS, users are suggested NOT to enable this 

option.

* This function is disabled by default.
